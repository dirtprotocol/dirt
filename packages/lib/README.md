# DIRTlib

DIRT allows anyone to deploy a datastore on Ethereum that is openly editable. We call this a Community Moderated Datastore (CMD) because there is no single owner. All the data is community owned and managed, and any service or application can use the data in a CMD.
Visit the DIRT developer portal (https://dev.dirtprotocol.com) for the full documentation.
